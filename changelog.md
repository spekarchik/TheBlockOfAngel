## 📦 Version 2.20.5

### 📝 Improvements

  - Exhaustion from using the **Builder**, **Track Layer**, and **Planter** has been increased by 2×.
  - **Rod of Terra**, **Fire Rod**, **End Rod**, and **The Rod of Angel** now also cause exhaustion when destroying *Cobwebs*, *Glowstone*, and *Tuff*.
  - **End Rod** and **The Rod of Angel** now cause exhaustion when changing *the weather*.
  - Exhaustion from modded sword effects (generation of *cobwebs*, *cacti*, and *fire*) has been increased by 4×.
    Exhaustion caused by *explosion* generation remains unchanged.
  - Regular attacks with modded swords now also cause additional minor exhaustion.
  - **The Rod of Angel** now causes exhaustion for each monster it despawns while being held in the player’s hand.
  - All magic exhaustion effects are disabled when the player’s *food level* is **0**.
- **Cracked Obsidian** and **Cracked End Stone** now use smelting instead of blasting.
- **Lymonite armor** and **Superyte armor** now restore health under rain only up to 10 HP and now causes higher exhaustion (**1.6** vs **1.0** per second).
- **Lymonite armor** and **Superyte armor** now ignite attackers with a 40% chance instead of 100%.
  

## 📦 Version 2.19.3

### 📝 Improvements
- **Builder**, **Planter**, and **Track Layer** recipes now only work if the source rod is undamaged.


## 📦 Version 2.19.2

### 📝 Improvements
- **Fire Rod**: *Glowstone* now drops Blaze Powder on left-click instead of requiring right-click.
- **End Rod**: *Tuff* now drops Saltpeter on left-click instead of requiring right-click.
- **End Rod**: Changing the weather now consumes saturation and adds exhaustion.
- Tooltips updated to reflect the new behavior.
- Removed unnecessary Jump icon when **Aeryte Armor's** Super Jump effect is active.
- Improved ore handling for area mining.
  - In Enhanced Mode, pickaxes now treat regular and deepslate variants of the same ore as the same ore.
    - When mining ores near Y=0, mixed regular and deepslate ore veins are now mined more naturally.
    - Mining a deepslate ore will also mine matching regular ore blocks in the area.
    - Mining a regular ore still only mines regular ore blocks; deepslate variants remain untouched, since deepslate ore is harder than regular ore.

### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed block interaction sounds not playing for the player in single-player mode when using magic rods.


## 📦 Version 2.18.0

  - The effect is maintained while the **Eye** is held in either hand.


## 📦 Version 2.15.1

### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the **Planter** failed to continue planting on partially filled rows if the seed stack was smaller than the remaining farmland length.

### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed armor effect toggles not disabling infinite-duration status effects other than *Levitation*.


## 📦 Version 2.14.2

- Players can now drop blocks holding back lava while inside lava.


## 📦 Version 2.14.1

### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed an issue where players wearing **Superyte Armor** could get stuck with an infinite *Levitation* effect when hit by a shulker.
  - This situation should no longer occur.
